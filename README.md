# Elevator_Introvert

Hi Profossor Oels, hope you're well. Feel free to peruse the mess I have here...
If you're looking for playable demos [here's the releases page](https://github.com/JacobJFM/Elevator_Introvert/releases).

### Some notes before playing:
As of writing, I have not implemented a way to quit the game easily, other than from the start menu, so if you get stuck and need to quit out, either press Cmd + Q on Mac or the Windows key, hover over the application icon in the taskbar, and quit it by pressing the X on the thumbnail. (Not the most elegant solution, I'm aware.)

You will likely need a mouse and keyboard to play. The controls are WASD for movement, Mouse for rotation, and left click to interact with things (mostly UI buttons but also one object in the game itself).

While I know it's not much, I would love to hear your thoughts on where you think I could take it.

***and if any of my classmates are here:***  
Hi! Hope this is somewhat fun to play around with at least. Really appreciate your suggestions. Was nice getting to know you all and hope you have a good one!
